## Run
To use all the capabilities of SmartCar, you must follow above figure's steps. Therefore, you just need to run main.py in the main repository./ You can also stereo calibration, real-time face detection, or the algorithm of the angle calculation for the rear mirror.

## Dependency
Before anything, make sure to have following libraries and packages.\
numpy
serial
opencv
